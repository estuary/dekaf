# DEKAF
This is a Kafka emulator that has just enough functionality to serve as a data provider
to a handful of systems. It may not be compatible with all Kafka clients. The API version
it supports is roughly equivalent to Kakfa 0.10. 

It is heavily based on this repo: https://github.com/travisjeffery/jocko

It is designed to be used as a library and there are several examples.
